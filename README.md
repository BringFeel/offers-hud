For more details, a list of offers for the focused merchant entity (for example, employed villager, wandering trader) will be displayed in the upper left corner of the screen.

This can be very useful, for example, for carefully selecting the details of a villager's trading offers.
You don't have to right-click on the villager every time you reposition the job site block.
